# Leica tribute page - Vanilla JS shopping cart

![Shopping Cart](README.png?raw=true "Shopping Cart")

### <a href="https://marius-adam.github.io/responsive-navbar/">LIVE DEMO</a>

## Description

This project was the final assignment of a Udemy course from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/janis-smilga-3/">John Smilga</a>
Users will be able to add and remove items from the shopping cart. Once in the shopping cart the user also has the option of increasing and decreasing the quantity of the items. Initially data was loaded from a local JSON file, however later on I transferred data to <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> because of their convenient and user friendly way of updating the content of the website.
